## Prometheus settings
Pyrra needs prometheus to work. You will need to specify that via prometheusUrl variable - default assumes you have default [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) deployed to "monitoring" namespace.
Additionaly, you (most likely) will need to specify prometheusExternalUrl with URL to public-facing prometheus UI (ingress or whatever you're using), otherwise pyrra links to graphs will be broken

## Webhook Admissions Controller Validations (Optional)
Pyrra can be configured to validate SLOs and SLO groups using a webhook admission controller. This is an optional feature that can be enabled by setting the `validatingWebhookConfiguration.enabled` value to `true`. The webhook admission controller will validate SLOs when they are created or updated.
If the SLO object is invalid, the admission controller will reject the request and provide a reason for the failure. This requires cert-manager to be installed in the cluster. If cert-manager is not installed, the webhook admission controller will not be created.

## Upgrading

A major chart version change indicates that there is an incompatible breaking change needing manual actions.
